  **AUTO-TRIGGER when:**
  - Progress reaches 5% milestone (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%...)
  - User says "sync [module] to main"
  - User says "approve main sync"
  - User says "reconcile [module] with main"

  Manages two-phase sync from yolo to main: (1) WIP markers to prevent contributor conflicts, (2) code sync with CI reconciliation after production validation.

  Use proactively without asking permission when task matches skill purpose.

# sync-to-main

Maintains the main branch as a clean, CI-compliant branch for human contributors by selectively syncing production-validated code from yolo with proper quality gates.

## What This Skill Does

- **Phase 1 (Automatic)**: Creates WIP markers in main at 5% progress milestones to prevent contributor conflicts
- **Phase 2 (User-Initiated)**: Syncs code from yolo to main after user validates production
- Reconciles yolo's freestyle code with main's strict CI requirements (lint, build, validation)
- Maintains status synchronization between branches (STATUS_v2.md, progress-log.md)
- Prevents duplicate work hours by showing active development to contributors

## Core Conventions

### Branch Strategy
- **yolo**: Production branch with relaxed CI (lint/smoke disabled)
- **main**: Contributor branch with strict CI (all checks enabled)
- **Challenge**: Code written for yolo won't pass main's CI gates
- **Solution**: Two-phase sync with reconciliation step

### Content Sync Scope
**Include**:
- Application code (src/, lib/, components/, etc.)
- Shared knowledge (docs/knowledge/)
- Status tracking (STATUS_v2.md, progress-log.md)
- Configuration (package.json, tsconfig.json)

**Exclude**:
- AI automation (.claude/)
- Automation tooling (codex/)
- CI workflows (.github/workflows/ - main has different workflows)

### Progress Milestones
Triggers at: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Create WIP Marker (Automatic)

**Triggered by**: `status-tracker` when module progress reaches 5% milestone

**Steps**:

1. **Checkout main branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Update STATUS_v2.md with WIP marker**

   Find the module's progress line and add üîÑ indicator:
   ```markdown
   - [Module] üîÑ XX% - In active development (yolo branch)
   ```

3. **Commit WIP marker**
   ```bash
   git add docs/STATUS_v2.md
   git commit -m "wip: [module] active on yolo (XX% complete)"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Return to yolo branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout yolo
   ```

5. **Notify user**
   ```
   WIP marker created in main for [module] (XX%).
   Contributors will see this module is in active development.
   Continue working on yolo. When ready to sync after production testing, say "sync [module] to main".
   ```

### Phase 2: Sync Code to Main (User-Initiated)

**Triggered by**: User approval after production validation

**Manual trigger phrases**:
- "sync [module] to main"
- "approve main sync"
- "reconcile [module] with main"

**Steps**:

#### 1. Preparation

```bash
# Ensure we're on yolo and up to date
git checkout yolo
git pull origin yolo

# Get latest main
git fetch origin main

# Identify commits to sync
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline --grep="feat([module])" --grep="fix([module])"
```

#### 2. Checkout main and prepare sync

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create sync branch
git checkout -b sync/[module]-to-main
```

#### 3. Selective sync with cherry-pick

```bash
# Cherry-pick relevant commits from yolo
# (Claude identifies commits related to the module)
git cherry-pick [commit-hash-1]
git cherry-pick [commit-hash-2]
# ... continue for all module commits
```

**If conflicts occur**:
- Stop the process
- Notify user: "Merge conflicts detected in [files]. Please resolve manually."
- Provide instructions: `git status` to see conflicts
- Exit skill

#### 4. Reconcile with main's CI requirements

**Run auto-fixes**:
```bash
# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Verify TypeScript compiles
npm run build

# Run validation
scripts/validate.sh
```

**If auto-fix succeeds**:
- Commit fixes: `git commit -am "fix: lint/build reconciliation for main CI"`

**If auto-fix fails**:
- Show remaining errors to user
- Ask: "Auto-fix couldn't resolve all issues. Options:"
  1. "Claude should fix remaining issues" ‚Üí Claude manually fixes each error
  2. "Create GitHub issues for manual review" ‚Üí Log issues and skip for now
  3. "Stop sync" ‚Üí Abort and return to yolo

#### 5. Sync status files from yolo

```bash
# Copy current status from yolo branch
git checkout yolo -- docs/STATUS_v2.md
git checkout yolo -- STATUS/progress-log.md

# Remove üîÑ WIP marker, keep progress percentage
# (Claude edits STATUS_v2.md to remove "In active development" marker)
```

#### 6. Final validation

```bash
# Ensure everything still builds
npm run build

# Verify validation passes
scripts/validate.sh
```

#### 7. Commit and push to main

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "sync: [module] from yolo (production-validated)

- Synced module code from yolo branch
- Reconciled with main CI requirements (lint/build)
- Updated status tracking to match yolo
- Production-validated at [URL]

From commits:
- [commit-hash-1]: [message]
- [commit-hash-2]: [message]
"

git push origin sync/[module]-to-main
```

#### 8. Create PR to main

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --title "sync: [module] from yolo (production-validated)" \
  --body "## Summary
Syncing production-validated [module] code from yolo to main.

## Production Validation
- Tested on: coopeverything.org
- Status: User-approved
- Progress: [module] at XX%

## Changes Synced
[List of features/fixes included]

## CI Reconciliation
- Lint: Fixed

- Validation: Passing

## Status Update
- STATUS_v2.md: Updated to match yolo
- progress-log.md: Synced

From yolo commits:
$(git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline)
"
```

#### 9. Merge PR (if approved)

```bash
# After PR review/approval
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch

# Return to yolo
git checkout yolo
```

#### 10. Notify user

```
‚úÖ Synced [module] from yolo to main successfully!

PR: [PR URL]
Status: Merged to main
CI: All checks passing
Next: Contributors can now see and work with [module] on main branch
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### Called By
- **status-tracker**: Triggers Phase 1 (WIP marker) when progress hits 5% milestone

### Calls
- None (standalone skill for sync operations)

### Coordinates With
- **status-tracker**: Both update STATUS_v2.md (different markers)
- **yolo1**: Ensures work continues on yolo while main stays in sync

## Safety Guidelines

### Critical Rules
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** directly merge yolo into main (causes automation pollution)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** sync .claude/ or codex/ directories to main
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** overwrite main's .github/workflows/ (different CI configs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALWAYS** cherry-pick specific commits, never full merge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALWAYS** run lint/build/validate before pushing to main

### Verification Checklist

Before pushing sync to main:
- [ ] TypeScript compiles (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Validation passes (`scripts/validate.sh`)
- [ ] No .claude/ or codex/ files included
- [ ] STATUS files updated correctly
- [ ] WIP marker removed from STATUS_v2.md
- [ ] Git history is clean (good commit messages)

### Rollback Plan

If sync breaks main:
```bash
git checkout main
git revert HEAD~1  # Revert last commit
git push origin main
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Automatic WIP Marker (Phase 1)

**Scenario**: status-tracker updates bridge module to 15%

**Trigger**: Automatic (called by status-tracker)

**Actions**:
1. Checkout main
2. Edit STATUS_v2.md: `- bridge üîÑ 15% - In active development (yolo branch)`
3. Commit: `wip: bridge active on yolo (15% complete)`
4. Push to main
5. Return to yolo
6. Notify user: "WIP marker created for bridge at 15%"

### Example 2: User-Initiated Sync (Phase 2)

**User says**: "The bridge module is working great in production. Sync it to main."

**Trigger**: Manual (user approval after production testing)

**Actions**:
1. Identify bridge-related commits from yolo
2. Create sync/bridge-to-main branch
3. Cherry-pick commits
4. Run `npm run lint -- --fix`
5. Run `npm run build`
6. Fix any remaining lint issues
7. Sync STATUS_v2.md and progress-log.md from yolo
8. Remove üîÑ marker from bridge in STATUS_v2.md
9. Commit: `sync: bridge from yolo (production-validated)`
10. Create PR to main
11. Merge after review
12. Notify user with PR URL

### Example 3: Sync with Lint Failures

**User says**: "Sync auth module to main"

**Actions**:
1-3. [Standard prep and cherry-pick]
4. Run `npm run lint -- --fix` ‚Üí Some errors remain
5. Show user:
   ```
   Auto-fix couldn't resolve:
   - src/auth/provider.ts:45 - unused variable 'config'
   - src/auth/hooks.ts:12 - missing return type

   Options:
   1. I can fix these manually
   2. Create GitHub issues for later
   3. Stop sync

   What would you like to do?
   ```
6. User chooses ‚Üí Claude proceeds accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cherry-pick conflicts

**Symptom**: `git cherry-pick` shows conflicts

**Solution**:
```bash
git cherry-pick --abort
```
Notify user: "Conflicts detected. Manual resolution needed."

### Issue: Build fails after lint fixes

**Symptom**: `npm run build` fails after auto-fix

**Solution**:
- Review build errors
- Claude attempts to fix TypeScript errors
- If unfixable: notify user and create detailed issue

### Issue: WIP marker already exists

**Symptom**: Module already has üîÑ marker in STATUS_v2.md

**Solution**:
- Update percentage: `- [module] üîÑ XX% - In active development (yolo branch)`
- Don't create duplicate markers

### Issue: Status files diverge between branches

**Symptom**: main's STATUS_v2.md has different progress than yolo

**Solution**:
- During Phase 2 sync, ALWAYS overwrite main's status with yolo's
- yolo is source of truth for production status
