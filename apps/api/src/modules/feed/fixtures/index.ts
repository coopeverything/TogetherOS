    content: `I've been thinking about starting a community garden in our neighborhood. We have an unused lot on Oak Street that could be perfect for this.

**Benefits:**
- Fresh, local produce
- Brings neighbors together
- Educational opportunities for kids
- Reduces food costs for participants

**What we need:**
- 10-15 committed members
- Basic tools and seeds (I can help source these)
- Permission from the city (I'll handle paperwork)

Why aren't we doing more of this here? Imagine if every company was owned by its workers. No exploitation, fair wages, democratic decision-making.

This is what cooperative economics looks like in practice.`,

    content: `What if we pooled our purchasing power to buy groceries in bulk directly from farms and wholesalers?

**The idea:**
- 30-50 households commit to monthly orders
- We negotiate bulk prices (30-50% savings)
- Rotate volunteer coordinators
- Pick-up at central location

**Example savings:**
- Organic vegetables: $3/lb â†’ $1.50/lb
- Local eggs: $6/dozen â†’ $3/dozen
- Dry goods: 40% off retail

**Next steps:**
- Gauge interest (need 20 households minimum)
- Find coordinator volunteers
- Contact local farms
