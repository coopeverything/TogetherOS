# Onboarding Experience

**Purpose:** Welcome newcomers, teach platform usage, develop cooperative skills, and establish engagement habits through rewarding learning experiences.

**Status:** 100% — Production Ready

---

## Overview

The Onboarding Experience transforms new members from curious visitors into confident contributors:

1. **Learning Paths** — Structured mini-lessons on platform and cooperation
2. **Quizzes & Exercises** — Knowledge checks with immediate feedback
3. **Skill Development** — Self-moderation, empathic communication, consensus-building
4. **Rewards & Badges** — Earn Reward Points (RP) for completing lessons
5. **Daily Engagement** — Streaks, challenges, and check-in rewards

### Design Principles

- **Tiny, rewarding steps:** 3-5 minute lessons with immediate feedback
- **Learn by doing:** Practical exercises over passive reading
- **Autonomy & choice:** Self-paced, optional paths, can skip topics
- **Social connection:** Cohort-based onboarding with peer recognition
- **Anti-addictive:** No FOMO, dark patterns, or infinite scroll

## Our Values in Action

### Transparency

Learning is open and honest:

- **Clear progress:** See exactly where you are and what's next
- **Visible rewards:** Know what you'll earn for each lesson
- **No hidden requirements:** All paths and badges are documented

### Open Source

The learning system is fully open:

- **Inspect the code:** See exactly how lessons work
- **Content visible:** All lesson materials are accessible
- **Contribute content:** Help improve onboarding for future members

### Community Governance

**This module is subject to change by the community through proposal and voting.** Coop-everything means what it says:

- **Curriculum decisions:** Community votes on what to teach
- **Reward structure:** Members decide RP values for activities
- **Feature requests:** Propose new learning paths through governance
- **Your voice matters:** From lesson content to quiz formats, members decide
