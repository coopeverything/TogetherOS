# Groups & Organizations Module

**Purpose:** Enable communities to self-organize into cooperative structures with transparent governance, shared resources, and federated capabilities.
---

## Overview

The Groups & Organizations module enables communities to coordinate and collaborate:

1. **Create Groups** — Start local, thematic, or federated communities
2. **Transparent Membership** — Clear roles with visible accountability
3. **Shared Decision-Making** — Group-scoped proposals and collective governance
4. **Federation Ready** — Connect with other groups across TogetherOS instances

### Design Principles

- **Local autonomy:** Each group maintains its own governance and privacy
- **Rotating leadership:** Roles are time-limited and recallable by the group
- **Visible accountability:** All role assignments and decisions are transparent
- **Federation-ready:** Groups can connect across instances while maintaining autonomy

## Our Values in Action

### Transparency

Every aspect of group organization is visible to members:

- **Public membership:** See who belongs to each group (with privacy controls)
- **Role visibility:** Who has what role and when their term expires
- **Decision history:** All group decisions are recorded and accessible
- **Contribution tracking:** See how members participate

### Open Source

The group management system is fully open:

- **Inspect the code:** See exactly how groups are created and managed
- **Audit permissions:** Role-based access control is documented and verifiable
- **Federation protocol:** Open standards for cross-group communication

### Community Governance

**This module is subject to change by the community through proposal and voting.** Coop-everything means what it says:

- **Self-organizing:** Groups decide their own rules and structures
- **Democratic roles:** Leadership positions are elected and recallable
- **Federated autonomy:** Connect with other groups while keeping local control
- **Member protection:** Privacy and safety controls decided by the community

## Types of Groups

### Local Groups

Geography-based communities that share physical resources:

- **Neighborhood networks:** Community gardens, tool libraries, mutual aid
- **City-level coordination:** Resource sharing, local events, solidarity economy
- **Examples:** "Boston Cooperative Network", "Oakland Tool Library"

### Thematic Groups

Interest-based communities that span locations:

- **Topic-focused:** Climate action, cooperative housing, education
- **Virtual-first:** Can collaborate across the globe
- **Examples:** "Open Source Educators", "Climate Adaptation Network"

### Federated Groups

Cross-instance communities that connect multiple TogetherOS deployments:

- **Inter-group coordination:** Share proposals and decisions across groups
- **Decentralized governance:** Each group maintains full autonomy
- **Examples:** Housing cooperatives across multiple cities

### Managing Roles

All roles have visible expiration dates and can be recalled by group decision.
