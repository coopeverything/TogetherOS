# Bridge Module - Progress Report

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
**Current Status:** 40% complete (Onboarding/Landing Pilot phase)
**Phase:** Landing Pilot (Internal MVP)

---

## Overview

Bridge is TogetherOS's AI-powered cooperation amplifier. The current focus is completing the **Landing Pilot** - a minimal `/bridge` page where visitors can ask "What is TogetherOS?" and get a calm, mission-first streamed answer.

---

## âœ… Completed (Phase 1 - Landing Pilot Foundation)

### Infrastructure & API
- [x] **Streaming API endpoint** - `POST /api/bridge/ask` with NDJSON streaming
- [x] **NDJSON logging** - Append-only logs to `logs/bridge/actions-YYYY-MM-DD.ndjson`
- [x] **Rate limiting** - IP-based throttling (30 req/hour configurable)
- [x] **Error taxonomy** - Proper HTTP status codes (204, 401, 429, 500)
- [x] **PII protection** - IP hashing, no raw prompts stored

### UI Components
- [x] **BridgeChat component** - React component with streaming support
- [x] **Basic styling** - Clean, accessible interface
- [x] **Loading states** - Animated indicators during streaming

### Configuration & Docs
- [x] **OpenAI integration** - API key setup and configuration
- [x] **Configuration docs** - `docs/modules/bridge/configuration.md`
- [x] **Enhanced error handling** - Fallbacks and user-friendly messages
- [x] **Module spec** - Complete spec in `docs/modules/bridge.md`
- [x] **Landing pilot spec** - Detailed plan in `docs/modules/bridge/landing-pilot.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (To Complete Landing Pilot)

### 1. Test with Real API Key
**Status:** To Do
**Size:** XS
**Description:**
- Test Bridge endpoint with actual OpenAI API key
- Verify end-to-end streaming works
- Validate NDJSON logs write correctly
- Test rate limiting behavior

**Acceptance:**
- Live `/bridge` page successfully streams answers
- NDJSON logs confirm requests are logged
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

---

### 2. Add Storybook Stories
**Status:** To Do
**Size:** S
**Description:**
- Create Storybook stories for BridgeChat component
- Cover all UI states:
  - Empty state (placeholder)
  - Loading/streaming (animated dots)
  - Success (answer displayed)
  - Error states (204, 401, 429, 500)

**Acceptance:**
- Storybook URL shows all states
- Stories pass accessibility checks
- Visual regression tests pass

---

### 3. Accessibility Audit
**Status:** To Do
**Size:** XS
**Description:**
- Run axe/lighthouse audit on `/bridge` page
- Fix any a11y issues:
  - Proper labels on inputs
  - Visible focus ring
  - Keyboard navigation (Enter to submit)
  - Reduced motion support

**Acceptance:**
- axe audit passes with no critical issues
- Lighthouse accessibility score â‰¥ 90
- Keyboard-only navigation works

---

### 4. Seed FAQ from Testers
**Status:** To Do
**Size:** S
**Description:**
- Collect 10-30 good questions from internal testers
- Curate into `docs/modules/bridge/faq-seed.md`
- Identify common question patterns
- Note any answer quality issues

**Acceptance:**
- `faq-seed.md` contains â‰¥10 high-quality Q&A pairs
- Helpful rating from testers â‰¥70%
- p95 time-to-first-token < 800ms
