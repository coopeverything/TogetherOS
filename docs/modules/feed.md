# Feed Module (Social + Forum + Intelligence)

## Overview

The Feed module is TogetherOS's primary engagement surface, combining social media UX with structured deliberation and AI-powered intelligence. It transforms passive content consumption into active participation through a conversion funnel: scroll → react → discuss → prioritize → vote → act.

**Current Progress:** <!-- progress:feed=0 --> 0%

**Category:** Community Connection, Collective Governance, Cooperative Technology

---

## Core Vision

**The Problem:**
People consume social media passively, react emotionally, then forget. No meaningful action results from their engagement.

**The Solution:**
A feed that guides users from consumption to participation:

1. **Scroll** - See posts (imported from social media + native TogetherOS posts)
2. **React** - Multi-dimensional engagement (not just likes)
3. **Discuss** - Open forum threads directly from posts
4. **Prioritize** - Build personal list of what matters
5. **Vote** - Participate in collective decisions (when threshold met)
6. **Act** - Join initiatives, make real change

**Bridge's Role:**
- Cluster posts by topic ("Show me other posts on housing")
- Prevent duplicate discussions ("Join existing thread instead")
- Profile interests and recommend actions
- Create sentiment maps and demographic insights
- Suggest when issues are ready for formal votes

## User Journey (Conversion Funnel)

### Stage 1: Discovery (Scroll)

**User lands on `/feed`**
- Sees mix of native posts + imported social media
- Infinite scroll, engaging UX
- Visual variety (text, images, embedded videos)

**Bridge tracks:**
- What topics appear in their feed
- How long they view each post
- Scroll patterns

### Stage 2: Engagement (React)

**User reacts to posts**
- Not just "like" - meaningful reactions (Care, Insightful, Agree, Act)
- Reactions are public (build trust, show community sentiment)

**Bridge tracks:**
- Reaction patterns (what do they care about?)
- Builds interest profile

**Bridge shows:**
- "You've reacted to 5 posts about housing. See more?"

### Stage 3: Participation (Discuss)

**User clicks "Discuss" on a post**
- Bridge checks: Is this topic already being discussed?
- If yes: "12 people are discussing housing. Join them?"
- If no: Opens composer to start new thread

**Discussion features:**
- Threaded replies (1 level deep for MVP)
- Multi-dimensional ratings (language, originality, tone, argument)
- Evidence attachment (links, data)

**Bridge tracks:**
- Topics they engage with deeply
- Quality of contributions (via ratings)

### Stage 4: Prioritization (Signal Importance)

**User builds personal priority list** (`/priorities`)
- Drag to reorder topics
- Slider: "How much do you care?" (1-10)

**Bridge uses this to:**
- Personalize feed
- Recommend related content
- Suggest actions

**Community dashboard** (`/map`)
- Shows aggregate priorities
- "37% of community prioritizes housing"
- "Climate concern up 12% this week"

### Stage 5: Deliberation (Structure Discussion)

**When forum thread shows sustained interest:**
- Active participation (30+ participants)
- Multiple viewpoints emerging
- Need for structured exploration

**Bridge suggests:**
- "Ready for deliberation? Explore options systematically"
- Opens deliberation mode (structured format)

### Stage 6: Decision (Formal Proposal)

**When deliberation yields clear options:**
- Options identified and explored
- Trade-offs understood
- Evidence gathered
- Community ready to decide

**Bridge suggests:**
- "Create formal proposal for community vote"
- Pre-fills from deliberation content
- Links to Governance module (when ready)

### Stage 7: Action (Make Change)

**Bridge recommends:**
- "You care about housing → Join [Housing Initiative Group]"
- "3 active projects need volunteers"
- "Proposal #47 needs your vote"

**Goal:** Convert caring into tangible participation

---

## Bridge Intelligence Features

### Topic Clustering

**Auto-detect topics from content:**
- User posts about "rent crisis in Boston"
- Bridge tags: Housing, Economics, Urban Planning
- Suggests existing tags before creating new ones

**Show related posts:**
- "Other posts on Housing" button
- Filters feed to topic
- Shows diversity of viewpoints

### Duplicate Prevention

**Before creating discussion thread:**
1. Bridge analyzes post content
2. Searches existing threads
3. Finds semantic matches

**Suggests:**
- "Join 'Affordable Housing Solutions' discussion (23 participants)"
- "Or start new thread if this is different"

**Prevents:**
- Fragmentation
- Duplicate effort
- Lost conversations

### Interest Profiling

**Tracks user behavior:**
- Topics they react to
- Topics they discuss
- Topics they prioritize
- Time spent on content

**Calculates interest percentages:**
- Bridge calculates: "Housing: 45%, Climate: 28%, Education: 15%, Healthcare: 12%"
- Shows relative interest across topics
- **Private view only** (not public)
- User can drag and rearrange in personal dashboard

**Privacy:**
- Calculations visible to user only
- No public profile display
- No selling to advertisers
- Exportable/deletable
- Transparent algorithm

### Sentiment Mapping

**Aggregates community sentiment (ANONYMOUS):**
- Per topic: agree/disagree ratios
- Consensus scores
- Action readiness
- Demographic breakdowns (if opted in)

**Prominently displayed statistics:**
- "What our members care about" dashboard
- "What people discuss today" trending topics
- Real-time engagement metrics
- **These are crucial** - front and center in UI

**Visualizations:**
- Bubble chart (topic size = engagement)
- Trend lines (sentiment over time)
- Demographic heat maps (urban vs rural priorities)

**Privacy guarantee:**
- All statistics are anonymous aggregates
- No individual data exposed
- Minimum threshold (n > 20) for demographic breakdowns

**Uses:**
- Help community understand itself
- Identify polarizing vs consensus issues
- Guide resource allocation
- Show collective priorities to motivate participation

### Action Recommendations

**Matches interests to opportunities:**
- User cares about housing → Housing initiative needs volunteers
- User interested in education → Proposal on school funding open for vote
- User skilled in coding → Tech project needs contributors

**Smart timing:**
- Not spammy (max 1 recommendation/week)
- Relevant to recent activity
- Clear calls to action

- Timing: After user shows repeated interest
- Not spammy (max 1/week)

---

### Phase 9: Deliberation Initiation (NOT Direct Voting)
**Scope:** Guide issues through discussion → deliberation → eventual governance

**The Funnel:**
```
Feed (interest signals)
  ↓ (high reactions, many comments)
Forum Post / Discussion Thread
  ↓ (sustained engagement, many participants)
Deliberation (structured exploration of options)
  ↓ (consensus emerging or clear divide)
Proposal (formal governance)
  ↓ (community vote)
Decision
```

**Step 9.1: Feed → Forum indicator**
- Bridge monitors feed posts for:
  - High reactions (50+ across types)
  - Comment engagement ("I want to discuss this")
  - Repeated imports on same topic
- Suggests: "This topic is attracting interest. Start a discussion?"
- Button: "Open forum thread"

**Step 9.2: Forum → Deliberation indicator**
- Bridge monitors forum threads for:
  - High participation (30+ unique participants)
  - Sustained activity (active for 3+ days)
  - Emerging viewpoints (multiple perspectives visible)
- Shows: "This discussion is ready for structured deliberation"
- Explains: "Deliberation helps explore options and trade-offs"

**Step 9.3: Deliberation → Proposal indicator**
- Bridge monitors deliberation for:
  - Clear options identified (2-5 viable paths)
  - Evidence gathered (supporting data attached)
  - Consensus forming OR clear need for decision
- Shows: "This deliberation is ready for a formal proposal"
- Pre-fills proposal template (doesn't auto-create)

**Step 9.4: Interest-based progression**
- **More interest in feed** = good indication topic will attract:
  - Discussion (forum engagement)
  - Deliberation (structured exploration)
  - Proposals (formal governance)
  - Voting (community decision)
- Bridge uses feed metrics to predict readiness
- Users control when to advance (not automatic)

**Step 9.5: Cross-module breadcrumbs**
- Feed post → shows if forum thread exists
- Forum thread → shows if deliberation opened
- Deliberation → shows if proposal created
- Proposal → links back to entire conversation history
- Unified narrative thread

## Validation Rules

### Post Validation

```typescript
const createNativePostSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(10).max(200).optional(),
  content: z.string().min(1).max(5000),
  topics: z.array(z.string()).min(1).max(5),
  groupId: z.string().uuid().optional(),
})

const createImportPostSchema = z.object({
  sourceUrl: z.string().url(),
  topics: z.array(z.string()).min(1).max(5),
  groupId: z.string().uuid().optional(),
})
```

### Thread Post Validation

```typescript
const createThreadPostSchema = z.object({
  threadId: z.string().uuid(),
  content: z.string().min(1).max(5000),
  parentId: z.string().uuid().optional(),
})
```

### Rating Validation

```typescript
const createRatingSchema = z.object({
  postId: z.string().uuid(),
  language: z.number().int().min(1).max(5),
  originality: z.number().int().min(1).max(5),
  tone: z.number().int().min(1).max(5),
  argument: z.number().int().min(1).max(5),
})
```

### Priority Validation

```typescript
const upsertPrioritySchema = z.object({
  topic: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  rank: z.number().int().min(1),
  weight: z.number().int().min(1).max(10),
})
```

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Funnel
- **Scroll:** Daily active users viewing feed
- **React:** % of viewers who react (target: >60%)
- **Discuss:** % of reactors who open forum threads (target: >20%)
- **Prioritize:** % of discussers who build priority list (target: >40%)
- **Deliberate:** % of active discussions that enter deliberation (target: >15%)
- **Propose:** % of deliberations that become formal proposals (target: >50%)
- **Vote:** % of proposals that get votes (target: >80%)
- **Act:** % of voters who join initiatives (target: >30%)

### Content Quality
- Average post ratings (language, originality, tone, argument)
- Evidence attachment rate (target: >30% of discussion posts)
- Duplicate thread prevention rate (Bridge success)

### Community Health
- Topic diversity (# of active topics)
- Sentiment balance (consensus vs polarization ratio)
- Demographic representation (are all voices heard?)

### Intelligence Effectiveness
- Recommendation click-through rate (target: >15%)
- Topic clustering accuracy (manual spot-checks)
- Action conversion rate (interest → joining initiative)

## Privacy & Safety

### What's Public
- All feed posts (unless in private group)
- Reactions (who reacted with what)
- Discussion content
- User reputation scores and badges
- Aggregate sentiment/priorities

### What's Private
- Interest profiles (used for recommendations only)
- Individual priority weights (only aggregates shown)
- Demographic data (anonymous aggregation, n > 20 threshold)
- Bridge profiling data (exportable/deletable)

### Safety Features
- Report/flag content (spam, harassment)
- Block users
- Mute topics
- Private groups (opt-in visibility)

### Data Rights
- Export all your data (GDPR compliance)
- Delete account (right to be forgotten)
- Opt out of profiling (manual curation only)
- Transparent algorithm (explain recommendations)

---

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- ✅ Auth (user identification)
- ✅ Profiles (author display)

**Integrated:**
- Groups (group-scoped posts, cross-posting)
- Governance (vote initiation from topics)
- Bridge (all intelligence features)

**Optional:**
- Notifications (mentions, replies, recommendations)
- Search (topic/post search)

---

## Migration Path

### MVP (Phases 1-2, ~1 week)
- Feed with native posts + imports
- Multi-dimensional reactions
- Basic discussions
- Topic filtering

**Goal:** Prove the scroll → react → discuss funnel works

### Enhanced (Phases 3-5, ~2 weeks)
- Bridge topic intelligence
- Personal + community priorities
- Multi-dimensional rating
- Reputation/badges

**Goal:** Show that prioritization drives focus

### Advanced (Phases 6-7, ~1-2 weeks)
- Evidence repository
- Sentiment mapping
- Demographic insights

**Goal:** Demonstrate sophisticated deliberation

### Integrated (Phases 8-9, ~1 week)
- Action recommendations
- Deliberation initiation (feed → forum → deliberation → governance)

**Goal:** Complete the full conversion funnel with proper progression stages

---

## Related Modules

- **Groups:** Group-scoped feeds, cross-posting
- **Governance:** Vote initiation when topics reach threshold

## Next Steps

**Phase 1 first step:**
- Module: feed
- Slice: scaffold
- Scope: Feed route, native post composer, post list with infinite scroll, multi-dimensional reactions, topic filtering, fixture data

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours (based on Groups 0% → 100% in 3 hours)

**Then iterate:** Ship one phase at a time, learn from real usage, adapt.

---

**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Next Milestone:** Feed MVP with native posts + imports + reactions (target: 30%)
**Owner:** @coopeverything-core
