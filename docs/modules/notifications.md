# Notifications & Inbox

**Purpose:** Keep members informed about activity that matters to them — mentions, replies, proposal updates, governance decisions, and community milestones.
---

## Overview

The Notifications module ensures you never miss important activity:

1. **Real-Time Alerts** — Instant notifications for mentions, replies, and updates
2. **Governance Updates** — Proposal status changes, voting reminders, decision outcomes
3. **Smart Filtering** — Filter by type (mentions, replies, governance, system)
4. **Batch Actions** — Mark all as read, clear notifications
5. **Preference Controls** — Customize what you receive and how

### Design Principles

- **Relevant, not noisy:** Only notify about things that matter to you
- **Actionable:** Each notification links directly to the relevant content
- **Respectful:** Digest options prevent notification overload
- **Private:** Your notification preferences and history are yours alone

## Our Values in Action

### Transparency

Notifications help you stay informed:

- **Open governance:** See when proposals move through stages
- **Clear attribution:** Know who mentioned you and where
- **Activity visibility:** Track responses to your contributions

### Open Source

The notification system is fully open:

- **Inspect the code:** See exactly how notifications are generated
- **No dark patterns:** No artificial urgency or manipulation
- **Auditable:** Notification logic is documented and reviewable

### Community Governance

**This module is subject to change by the community through proposal and voting.** Coop-everything means what it says:

- **Notification types:** Community decides what events trigger notifications
- **Default settings:** Vote on what's enabled by default
- **Digest frequency:** Members choose email frequency options
- **Your voice matters:** From notification triggers to retention periods, members decide
