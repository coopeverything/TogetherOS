# Community Discussions & Deliberation

**Purpose:** Provide a versatile space for knowledge building, idea exploration, Q&A, and structured deliberation where the community can develop ideas together.
---

## Overview

The Community Discussions module provides a multi-purpose forum for:

1. **Knowledge Repository** — Best practices, how-tos, community wisdom
2. **Idea Bank** — Explore ideas before formalizing as proposals
3. **Q&A Hub** — Ask questions, share expertise, build collective knowledge
4. **Deliberation Space** — Structured consensus-building when decisions loom
5. **Announcements** — Share important updates with the community

### Design Principles

- **Empathy-first:** Reactions encourage understanding over agreement
- **Minority voice preservation:** Dissenting opinions are highlighted, not hidden
- **Evidence-based:** Attach citations and references to support viewpoints
- **Transparent moderation:** All moderation actions are logged and visible

## Our Values in Action

### Transparency

Every discussion is visible and auditable:

- **Public discussions:** All topics and posts are visible to members
- **Edit history:** Changes to posts are tracked and visible
- **Moderation logs:** All moderation actions are transparent
- **Citation verification:** Sources can be checked and verified

### Open Source

The forum system is fully open:

- **Inspect the code:** See exactly how discussions are organized
- **Community-driven:** Tagging and categorization follow our shared taxonomy
- **No hidden algorithms:** Posts appear in chronological order, not by engagement manipulation

### Community Governance

**This module is subject to change by the community through proposal and voting.** Coop-everything means what it says:

- **Moderation rules:** Community decides what moderation looks like
- **Category structure:** The 8 Cooperation Paths can be extended by proposal
- **Feature requests:** Propose new discussion features through governance
- **Your voice matters:** From reaction types to flagging rules, members decide
