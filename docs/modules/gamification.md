# Gamification — Community Growth & Engagement

**Purpose:** Encourage local community formation through ethical, research-backed milestone tracking, celebration moments, and invitation rewards.
---

## Overview

The Gamification module helps communities grow through:

1. **Milestone Tracking** — Research-backed thresholds (Dunbar numbers)
2. **Progress Visualization** — See your community's growth path
3. **Celebration Moments** — Beautiful animations for achievements
4. **Invitation Rewards** — Both inviter and invitee benefit
5. **Capability Unlocks** — Real features, not just cosmetics

### What Makes This Different

- **Research-backed:** Milestones align with proven community sizes (Dunbar numbers)
- **Unlock capabilities:** Every threshold enables new coordination features
- **Transparency:** No hidden algorithms, all formulas visible
- **Dual-sided rewards:** Both parties benefit from connections
- **Ethical design:** No FOMO, loss aversion, or manipulation

## Our Values in Action

### Transparency

Everything about gamification is visible:

- **Public formulas:** See exactly how rewards are calculated
- **Research basis:** Milestones link to academic studies
- **Progress visibility:** Track your community's growth openly
- **No hidden mechanics:** All algorithms documented

### Open Source

The gamification system is fully open:

- **Inspect the code:** See how milestones and rewards work
- **Academic citations:** Research foundation is documented
- **Ethical framework:** ETHIC principles guide design

### Community Governance

**This module is subject to change by the community through proposal and voting.** Coop-everything means what it says:

- **Milestone thresholds:** Community can adjust growth targets
- **Reward amounts:** Members vote on RP values
- **Feature unlocks:** Decide what capabilities unlock at each tier
- **Your voice matters:** From celebration animations to quiet mode, members decide

### Safeguards

- **Max 5 invitations per week** (prevent spam)
- **Geographic matching** (enforce local focus)
- **Quality tracking** (your invite success rate is visible)
- **Transparent scoring** (see how your invites perform)

## Progress Visualization

Your community growth is always visible:

- **Member count** with growth indicator
- **Achieved milestones** with badges
- **Progress bar** to next threshold
- **Next unlock preview** showing what's coming
- **Invitation CTA** with reward preview

---

## Celebrations

When your community hits a milestone:

- **Beautiful animations** (skippable, accessible)
- **Achievement message** explaining significance
- **Action nudge** suggesting next steps
- **RP reward** for completing the action

### Accessibility

- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Always skippable (button + ESC key)
- Screen reader support
- Static alternative for reduced motion users

## Quiet Mode

Don't want gamification? No problem:

- Toggle "Quiet mode" in settings
- Hides RP rewards, celebrations, nudges
- Progress still tracked (re-enable anytime)
- No judgment, no nagging

---

## Ethical Framework

We follow the ETHIC principles:

- **Empowerment:** Milestones unlock real capabilities
- **Transparency:** Public weights, visible calculations
- **Honesty:** Rewards intrinsic goals, no dark patterns
