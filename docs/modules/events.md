## Overview

The Events & Calendar module enables communities to coordinate and celebrate:

## Our Values in Action

### Transparency

All community activities are visible:

- **Public calendar:** See what's happening in your community
- **Attendance records:** Know who participated in decisions
- **Meeting notes:** Capture and share what was discussed
- **Milestone tracking:** See progress toward community goals

### Open Source

The calendar system is fully open:

- **Inspect the code:** See exactly how events are organized
- **Standard formats:** Export to iCal, integrate with external calendars
- **No lock-in:** Your event data is portable

### Community Governance

**This module is subject to change by the community through proposal and voting.** Coop-everything means what it says:

- **Event policies:** Community decides what types of events to support
- **Privacy settings:** Members vote on default visibility options
- **Feature requests:** Propose new calendar features through governance
- **Your voice matters:** From RSVP rules to notification preferences, members decide
