## Bio

I'm a software developer and community organizer passionate about cooperative technology and democratic decision-making. For the past five years, I've been building tools that help communities self-organize and make decisions together.

I believe technology should serve people, not profit. I'm here to connect with others who are building alternative economic systems and to contribute my skills to cooperative projects.
