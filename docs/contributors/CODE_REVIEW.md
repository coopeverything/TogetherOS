### Providing Feedback

**Be kind and constructive:**
- ‚úÖ "Consider extracting this into a helper function for reusability"
- ‚úÖ "This could be simplified using array.map()"
- ‚úÖ "Great approach! One suggestion..."
- ‚ùå "This is wrong"
- ‚ùå "Why would you do it this way?"
- ‚ùå "This is terrible code"

**Be specific:**
- ‚úÖ "On line 42, this variable name could be more descriptive. Suggest `userEmail` instead of `e`"
- ‚ùå "Variable naming needs work"

**Distinguish must-fix from suggestions:**
- **üî¥ Must fix:** "This will cause a crash when email is null"
- **üü° Suggestion:** "Consider adding error logging here for debugging"
- **üí° Optional:** "Nice-to-have: Could add a loading state"

**Ask questions:**
- "What happens if the API returns null?"
- "Is this condition always true?"
- "Could you explain this logic?"

**Acknowledge good work:**
- "Nice refactoring!"
- "Great test coverage"
- "This handles the edge case well"

### Review Priorities

**P0 - Must fix before merge:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Crashes or data loss
- Breaking changes without migration
- Secrets committed
- Validation failing

**P1 - Should fix:**
- Bugs (non-critical)
- Poor error handling
- Missing tests for critical paths
- Confusing code
- Documentation gaps

**P2 - Nice to have:**
- Code style improvements
- Additional test coverage
- Performance optimizations
- Refactoring suggestions

**P3 - Future work:**
- Feature enhancements
- Long-term improvements
- Follow-up tasks

### Types of Review Comments

**Comment** - General feedback, doesn't block merge
```
üí° Consider extracting this into a utility function
```

**Request changes** - Must be addressed before merge
```
üî¥ This will throw an error when user is undefined. Add null check.
```

**Approve** - LGTM (Looks Good To Me)
```
‚úÖ Approved! Great work on the error handling.
```

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Review

Reviewer checks:
- PR description and proof lines
- CI checks status
- Files changed
- Overall approach

### 2. Line-by-Line Review

Reviewer examines:
- Code logic
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Tests
- Documentation

### 3. Feedback & Discussion

- Reviewer leaves comments
- Author responds or makes changes
- Conversation continues until resolved

### 4. Approval

When satisfied, reviewer approves:
- All concerns addressed
- Code meets standards
- Tests pass
- Documentation updated

### 5. Merge

After approval(s):
- Maintainer or author merges
- Branch is deleted
- Changes go to main

## Common Review Scenarios

### Scenario: Breaking Change

**Reviewer:** "This changes the API response format. How will existing clients handle this?"

**Good response:** "Good catch! I'll add a version parameter and keep the old format for v1 clients. Will update in next commit."

### Scenario: Missing Tests

**Reviewer:** "The error path isn't tested. Can you add a test case?"

**Good response:** "Absolutely! Added test in commit abc123. Does that cover it?"

### Scenario: Unclear Code

**Reviewer:** "This logic is hard to follow. Can you simplify or add comments?"

**Good response:** "You're right, it's convoluted. Refactored into smaller functions with descriptive names. Much clearer now."

### Scenario: Performance Concern

**Reviewer:** "This queries the database in a loop. Consider batching?"

**Good response:** "Great suggestion! Changed to a single query with WHERE IN. 10x faster in testing."

### Scenario: Scope Creep

**Reviewer:** "This PR adds feature X but also refactors unrelated code Y. Can we split it?"

**Good response:** "Good point! I'll move the refactoring to a separate PR. This one will focus only on feature X."

## When Reviews Get Stuck

### Long Discussion

If a conversation goes beyond 3-4 exchanges:
1. Hop on a call or discussion thread
2. Seek input from maintainers
3. Document the decision
4. Move forward

### Disagreement

If reviewer and author disagree:
1. Both explain reasoning clearly
2. Seek third opinion from maintainer
3. Defer to maintainer decision
4. Document the tradeoff

### Slow Review

If review is taking too long:
1. Ping reviewer politely after 2-3 days
2. Ask for estimated timeline
3. Request alternate reviewer if needed
4. Escalate to maintainers if urgent

## Review Timeline

**Target response times:**
- **Initial review:** Within 2 business days
- **Re-review after changes:** Within 1 business day
- **Small/urgent PRs:** Within 24 hours
