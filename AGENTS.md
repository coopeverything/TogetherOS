# Agents & PR Discipline

## PR metadata (required in every PR description)
Add **both** lines to your PR description:


- Canonical categories & keywords: [docs/TogetherOS_CATEGORIES_AND_KEYWORDS](docs/TogetherOS_CATEGORIES_AND_KEYWORDS)
- Detailed taxonomy specification: [docs/cooperation-paths.md](docs/cooperation-paths.md)
- Contributor guide & workflow: [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md) | [docs/contributors/](docs/contributors/)

Notes:
- Use exactly one Category.
- Choose 2–6 Keywords from the palette for routing/search/analytics.
- PRs without the two lines will be asked to update their description before review (automation enforcement lands next).
