# TogetherOS — A new operating system for humanity

OS = Operating System (not “open source”). TogetherOS is a cooperation-first stack that helps people self-organize: direct legislation, mutual aid, a fair social economy, and shared knowledge — all woven into practical tools and clear discipline for contributors.

## The 8 Cooperation Paths (canonical)

- **Collaborative Education** — learn, co-teach, certify, and document shared knowledge so communities can build faster together.  
- **Social Economy** — mutual aid, time-banking, micro-funds, and **Social Horizon** crypto to finance the commons.  
- **Common Wellbeing** — health, nutrition, movement, and care networks that reduce isolation and improve daily life.  
- **Cooperative Technology** — open, privacy-respecting tools and infrastructure that communities own and operate.  
- **Collective Governance** — open deliberation, direct legislation, and empathy-first moderation for real democratic power-sharing.  
- **Community Connection** — local groups, events, co-ops, and city-level collaboration mapped to real people and places.  
- **Collaborative Media & Culture** — stories, film, music, writing, and archives that celebrate cooperation and courage.  
- **Common Planet** — habitat repair, food forests, circular materials, and climate-positive logistics.
